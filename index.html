			 I'm a web developer with a digital humanities focus. I develop sites that are beautiful, intuitive, and useful. <br><br>
				
			From archaeological digs in the Mediterranean to dusty museum archives to college computer labs, I've seen how technology can provide indispensable tools for education, research, and communication.

		<div class="column-2">
			<br> <br>
			As an undergraduate studying anthropology, it quickly became clear that the barrier that persisted between computer science and more "traditional" pathways of study like the humanities and social sciences was unproductive and ultimately harmful. <br><br>

			I believe that technology is more a tool than an area of study, and we all benefit when people of diverse backgrounds and interests learn to build with code.
